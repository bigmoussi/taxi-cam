// with at most 65536 aggregate code bytes. Every complete range must fit within
// one declared readable, non-writable, executable, non-discardable image section.
// Hash is FNV-1a64 over the observed loaded bytes, not a cryptographic signature.
//
// Fresh AMD64 PE32+ header identity and base-relocation metadata are checked
// first. Any non-ABSOLUTE relocation affecting a requested byte is refused.
// Every relocation block header is checked. Payloads are read only for pages
// that could affect a selected range, including a DIR64 field crossing up to
// seven bytes into the next page. In those blocks, supported types are ABSOLUTE,
// HIGHLOW and DIR64; other types fail conservatively. Skipped payloads are not
// validated. The byte allowance limits actual attempted reads, not directory
// size; no block-count or read limit is bypassed. Storage must be readable, non-writable,
// image data. The exact PE directory can reside in an executable section;
// parsing that metadata never executes it. Its discardable flag is permitted only while
// query/read still succeeds. Missing/inaccessible/malformed metadata cannot be
// bypassed, and no target pointer is followed or function invoked.
//
// This detects changed bytes at inspection time, not future modification,
// authenticity, a calling convention, thread safety or safe engine lifetime.
