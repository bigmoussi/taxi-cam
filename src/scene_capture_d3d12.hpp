// One reusable, caller-serialized GPU capture packet. It never changes a
// pipeline, executes an engine list or opens a process. Copy-source capture
// leaves application state unchanged; native RT-boundary capture temporarily
// transitions the source and restores its exact incoming state/layout.
//
// Production integration requirements (not inferred by this class):
// 1. Match an actual live copy callback argument to the current scene/resource
//    generation ticket. If the scene is the application's destination, require
//    an exact whole-texture copy and capture its original source instead.
// 2. For the copy path, forward the original once. Call record_copy_source on that same OPEN
//    DIRECT list outside a render pass while the exact source is copy-readable.
//    Only whole single-mip/layer textures are supported; no state guesses. The
//    separate RT methods require the stronger native barrier proof below.
// 3. Before retire_recording, establish that every submission of this recording
//    has returned, all used ONE producer queue, and this recording cannot execute
//    again. ReShade's pre-execute/pre-reset callbacks do NOT establish this.
// 4. Only use ready_resource after the producer fence completes. Submit private
//    DIRECT compositor work using COPY_DEST as the input before state, restoring it to
//    COPY_DEST, then signal a consumer fence after ALL such uses. Only recycle
//    after that fence is complete. AddRef alone supplies no synchronization.
//
// An initialized pool reuses textures/fences without per-frame allocation.
// Pending packet destruction intentionally quarantines references until process
// exit rather than freeing GPU-referenced memory. Caller should retain packets
// and finish their recording/consumer lifecycle instead. No live-camera/PFD
// integration or render-completion inference is supplied by this primitive.
